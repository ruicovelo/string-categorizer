This is one of my learning projects.

In this case, I created this project to learn about Python, git, Github and experimenting with regular expressions, searching in strings and categorizing strings based on its content.
I will start with some very basic scoring algorithms because I need this function for some of my scripts.
In the long run, I would like to experiment with Bayesian learning for string categorization (much like spam filters work) but I probably will never get the time to relearn this subject. 

So don't expect something great coming out of this ;). I'm sure there are projects/frameworks available for this much more interesting than this one. But would I'm sure I will learn more about this if I try and fail to create my own.
